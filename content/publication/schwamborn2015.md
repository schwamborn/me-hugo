# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Human mobility has been shown to be of significant impact on the performance of Opportunistic Networks (OppNets). As shown in earlier work, the integration of geographic restrictions is not only a further step to more credibility of OppNet simulative performance evaluation, but also influences relevant metrics, such as contact duration and number of contacts. In this paper, we discuss and propose solutions to modeling issues related to geographic restrictions and investigate the impact of the road network underlying the scenario's map extract. Inter-Contact Times (ICTs) are not significantly impacted by the diversity in road network structure but considerably shorter and less contacts are reported for Tokyo's dense road network, making it an especially challenging urban scenario for forwarding algorithm performance evaluation."
